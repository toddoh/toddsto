          <p>Waverly Street is a place and collective where I ponder the socioeconomic dynamics of modern society through the lens of multicultural contexts and philosophy.</p>
          <p>It begins with the experiences I've had. Growing up with multiple cultural influences and ideas, and carving my own path in life, I was surrounded by a unique set of perspectives on people, society, nationality, and life itself. It's something almost impossible to fully describe, but it brought me many questions about how our society is constructed and about the intricate layers between those constructs and the different cultures woven under the greater umbrella of life.</p>
          <p>In a world where cultures and societies constantly come together and drift apart, I saw even more reasons to keep pondering. I wanted to keep discovering the hidden avenues and quiet pockets of life within different cultures, and to find the intersections and dynamics that shape the society we live in. This is the place where I share that journey with a broader group of people — hence the name, Waverly Street.</p>

          <p>I grew up in South Korea under the heavy influence of American, Korean, and Japanese cultures. I spent my college years studying sociology and exploring who I am and different elements of modern society. I later moved to the United States with my husband and am now based in New York. These days, I strive to translate my philosophy on life into something tangible.</p>
